\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

During the past ten weeks, my project started out as repeating a published model and ended up with some new exciting directions to explore. Besides my hands-on experiments, I also participated in a lot paper reading and discussion on RL in the group, which got me acquainted to a whole new area and a group of interesting people.

This ten-week internship has been deeply rewarding. As a college-senior-to-be, I've never been more capable of doing research and I've never gotten the opportunity of fully devoting myself to research for such a long time span. This experience has been exhausting and mad fun at the same time, and it further established my mind to be a researcher, and a truth seeker.
